              What is the Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">It is essentially a computer-aided clinical decision system which computes the inputs of an electronic blood pressure instrument, electrocardiogram/pulse meter, oxymeter, hemoglobinometer and a core-body thermometer. The computer also receives &ldquo;typed-in&rdquo; personal information of the user, which includes age, gender, height and body-weight. </p><br />

              What are the advantages of the Cardiopuls method?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              The primary advantage of the Cardiopuls method is its overwhelming simplicity and reliable accuracy. It is user and user-friendly and capable of obtaining a real-time recognition of the user&rsquo;s hemodynamic profile in any given condition (sterile or non-sterile). Other advantages and applications of Cardiopuls are: Accuracy, Bias and Precision are comparable to other currently used noninvasive cardiac output measurements methods; it can be used independently of time, place and instrumentation of when the actual user measurements are taken; ideally suited for telemedicine consultation and eICU applications; can be used retrospectively; can be used for progressive or &quot;what if&quot; studies; can be used as an invasive technique for operative and postoperative applications; therapeutic management can be selected according to the computed hemodynamic results; trending of user response to medication can be easily followed; can be used as a screening device in an ambulatory setting; no training required; no safety risk to users; no standardization is required; no maintenance is required; the most cost-effective and accurate noninvasive hemodynamic method available; and ideally suited for use on critical care users. <br />

              Is the Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer similar to the others methods?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              The Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer, as with any other noninvasive and invasive techniques, applies algorithms to calculate the hemodynamic parameters and is based on well-established scientific principles. It has received two patents from the U.S. Patent Office due to its unique design and function that are fundamentally different than any other measurement method. <br />
              <br /></p>

              <p class="intro" style="color: #B51423"> <img alt="" src="ques.png" style="margin-bottom: 4px" />&nbsp;
              How accurate is the Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer's computations?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              We have conducted extensive research and applied the Cardiopuls method to thousands of users. We have written and published a peer-reviewed scientific paper on the comparison of measuring cardiac output on 203 critical care users using Cardiopuls with the thermodilution method. The paper includes a literature survey which indicates the Bias, Precision and Accuracy of four different noninvasive methods are comparable to Cardiopuls technique. See, Kabal J, and Lagerman BK. A novel approach to measure cardiac output noninvasively: A comparison with the thermodilution method on critical care users. J Clin Monit 18(3): 189-197, 2004. <br />

              What hemodynamic parameters can be obtained using Cardiopuls?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              Contrary to the other noninvasive cardiac output measurement methods, the Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer computes (according to the type of test) between 14 to 24 hemodynamic parameters. For example, a hypertension evaluation results in determining the following hemodynamic parameters: Mean Arterial Pressure, Chronotropy, Cardiac Index, Systemic Vascular Resistance Index, Left Cardiac Work Index, Oxygen Delivery Index, Stroke Index, Ejection Fraction, Left Ventricular End Diastolic Index, Inotropy, Acceleration Index, Left Ventricular End Diastolic Pulse Pressure, and Left Ventricular Stroke Work Index.  To compare the hemodynamic values of different individuals, parameters are &ldquo;indexed&rdquo; by dividing them by the Body Surface Area (BSA). <br />

              In which clinical areas can the Cardiopuls be used?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              The Cardiopuls method can be favorably applied to any medical application currently using other noninvasive or invasive methods to measure cardiac output including hypertension, coronary disease and congestive heart failure. The Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer is an ideal screening device for these diseases as well.<br />
              <br /></p>

              <p class="intro" style="color: #B51423"> <img alt="" src="ques.png" style="margin-bottom: 4px" />&nbsp;
              What are the limitations of this new method?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              It can be used only for adults of both sexes over the age of 18 years. Furthermore, in the presence of arrhythmia, the measurements are not valid as is the case with any other cardiac output measuring method.<br />
              <br /></p>

              Is the Cardiopuls noninvasive hemodynamic analyzer appropriate as a screening device for hypertension?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              Yes. Our published research concludes the Cardiopuls method is an accurate, simple, economic, and real-time screening device for hypertension and other cardiac diseases. See, Kabal J, and Lagerman BK. Hemodynamic evaluation of exercise treadmill test by a computer&ndash;aided clinical decision system. Cardiovascular Engineering: An International Journal Vol. 4, No. 3, September 2004<br />

              What are the advantages of a hemodynamic exercise treadmill test?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              The advantage is to be able to identify the hemodynamic responses of different cardiovascular conditions. No additional instrumentation is required. However, we recommend using automatic electronic blood pressure instrument (allowing for user movement). Future research will establish the magnitude of the obtained specificity and sensitivity for the detection of Coronary Artery Disease. Published data support the assumption that the traditional test with the hemodynamic test is superior. See, Kabal J, and Lagerman BK.

              What hemodynamic parameters are obtained by Cardiopuls from the exercise treadmill test?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              This test provides comprehensive results (22 hemodynamic parameters) which allow the medical practitioner to more fully evaluate the user&rsquo;s cardiac function. <br />
              <br /></p>

              Can the results of a Cardiopuls evaluation be presented in graphical form?</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px">
              Yes. Individual user results are normally presented in a series of graphs to allow the medical practitioner to quickly assess the user&rsquo;s condition with normal cardiac function.<br />
